User Testing Observations

Things the testers found easy
- easy to click on an item from three boxes in the homepage to get more detail
- search for characters/potions/spells whose names contain the search string and 
    use the suggestion box to find the item and go to detail page
- easy to find where to find menu cause the menu button is the most classic regular three-bar one 
    (although now our menu sidebar itself does not work somehow)

Things people had trouble with
- on home page, many people asked what they should/could search so it is not clear what the website may contain
    I think maybe we can add more instrustion in the search box saying like search for characetrs/potions/spells.
- sometimes people click on the little icon showing characters/potion/spell but those are just images and 
    are not button
- One tester mentioned that it is not convenient to have all the items listed in the homepage 
    while people have to scroll all the way down to find someone
    I wonder if the yet-completed implementation
-searching spells with the incantation and can't find the spell
    (it is an intuitive thing to do so maybe we should let the search be able to search spell with incantation too)

Other positive comments or observations
- people like the wand cursor and it is not confusing. People know it is the cursor
- the search bar works well and is easy to use overall
- one tester liked the scrollable item boxes

Other suggestions for improvement
- two tester found that when you go to detail page the wand cursor becomes normal cursor, 
    so it could be changed to be ore consistent
