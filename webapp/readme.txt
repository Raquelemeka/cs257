STATUS:
What's working:
Currently the website has all the basic functions we expected. 
It allows users to browse all character/potions/spells on the homepage and click on the item to view details.
It also allow users to go to a filter page where more advanced searching and filtering can be done.
Users can go to teh filter page by click on the navigate buttons "characters/spells/potions"
If they go to filter page by clicking on the characters button, the filter page would automatically select all characters for them.
More filters can be added by the users themselves. For example, after users select character, 
they can then choose Gryffindore and male so they see all the male Gryffindore characters in teh list below.
If users choose potions, and type calm in the effect, they would see calming Draught, a potion with effect described as "calm the drinker".
Besides, we also have a search bar that allows users to search any characters/spells/potions by name.
A suggestion box would pop up while people typing to show what results match the string input.
The users can select the target item form the suggestion bar and go see the detail page.
On the top left corner there is a logo says HP wiki, if you click on that, you will go to the api help page.
Other than the functions, we allow users to go back and forth between the website by offering a back to home button and a go to filter button.
Also, to make it clearer what is a button and what is just text, I added a pop effect to the buttons everytime the cursor hovers on them.


What's not:
I had an idea to allow users to go to a detail page from the filter page, and when they click go to filter button,
the filter page they visit again would save the filter setting they had last time so they do not have to select all the things again.
However, it has not been realized yet cause I tried a several different ideas and could not implement it without breaking other part of my code.
Also, although we have a search button on the search bar in the homepage, it does not serve as the agent to apply search.
When users enter inputs, tehy would go to the detail page through clicking on the items in teh suggestion box.
Therefore, the search button does not participate in searching. I feel like this button should be there, but I am not sure what kind of function 
I can give to it so it is not just a decoration.  
Another thing is that now we do not have portrait for all the characetrs since I manually searched for pictures and store them in the folders.
It could be more efficient to do it in a different way maybe with online search so we can have more photos of the characters.
Also for the potions and spells, I cannot come up with any better ideas than presenting the same image for all the items. It is not a very 
intersting viusal aid, but I am not sure what else can be placed there.

NOTES:
For the copyright info, I only include the website link to where I have found the pictures. I hope that is enough for this project since it is not for business or anything like that.
Thank you for teaching this semester, have a wonderful summer!
